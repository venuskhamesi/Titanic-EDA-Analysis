ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Analysis â€“ A Visual Exploration with EDA

This project dives into the famous Titanic dataset to explore what influenced passenger survival during the tragic voyageâ€”using Python and clear visual storytelling through data.

---
 ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this project is to uncover survival patterns based on key features like Gender, Age, Ticket class, and Fareâ€”using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Languages & Libraries: Python (pandas, NumPy)  
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn  
- Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ§ª Project Workflow

1. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values and detected outliers  

2. ðŸ“‹ Descriptive Statistics  
- Analyzed feature distributions and survival balance  

3. ðŸ“Š Visualizations  
- Created charts and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables and survival outcomes  

4. ðŸ’¡ Insights  
- Females and younger passengers had higher survival rates  
- Fare varied significantly across passenger classes  
- No strong linear correlation was found between age and fare

ðŸ§  Key Findings

- Among 891 passengers, 342 survived (~38.4%)  
- Gender and age were strong indicators of survival  
- Traveling alone was negatively associated with survival chances
