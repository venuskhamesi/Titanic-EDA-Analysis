# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns behind passenger survival during the Titanic disaster using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 📌 Objective
To analyze and visualize factors affecting passenger survival, such as gender, age, class, and fare, using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Analyzed distributions and class balance
3. **Visualization**
   - Created charts and heatmaps to explore relationships
4. **Insights**
   - Female and younger passengers had higher survival rates
   - Fare varied significantly by class
   - No strong linear correlation between age and fare

## 🧠 Key Findings
- Out of 891 passengers, 342 survived (~38.4%)
- Gender and age were strong predictors of survival
- Traveling alone was negatively associated with survival
